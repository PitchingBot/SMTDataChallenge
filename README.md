# Using Player & Ball Motion Data to Build a Highly Flexible Defensive Positioning Algorithm in Baseball
## Presented for the SMT Data Challenge at UCSAS 2022

Please find the report in the file "SMT_Data_Challenge.pdf".

The R scripts in the root directory contain code used to train the various defensive models. CSV files of outputs are contained in the "data" folder. Models are saved as RDS objects in the "model" folder.

Source code for the shiny application is located in the "Shift_Tester_App" folder if you wish to run it locally.
